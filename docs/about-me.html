                        <p>I was always a square peg in a round hole. My father, an engineer by trade, expected me to excel in math and I did, but eventually I became drawn to the arts and painting. I neither fit in with the intellectuals because I was too “artsy,” and I didn’t fit in with the art kids, because I was too &quot;smart.”</p>
                        <p>I pursued my artistic passions studying painting at Rhode Island School of Design. There I incorporated my intellectual sensibilities into my artwork. My work encompassed urban landscapes as vast macro-organism. A constant attempt at reconciling opposites; the artificial with the organic, the rational with the intuitive.</p>
                        <p>It was difficult to find my niche as a painter, and I decided to start fresh in a studio apartment in Chicago. Efficiently utilizing the space I created a digital studio by balancing my computer on a drawing board propped on my couch-bed. There I hammered away, teaching myself design and applying what I learned by building my personal website.</p>
                        <p>As a designer, I am able to meld the intellectual with the artistic that had been the source of internal strife throughout my life. Not satisfied with just the design component, I took it upon myself to learn how to code. Web design affords me the opportunity to build my designs and watch my creations come to life. I am always looking to harmonize my intuitive and rational natures in my life and work. Some see it as squaring the circle. I see it as jamming a square peg into a round hole.</p>
